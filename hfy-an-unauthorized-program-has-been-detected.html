                            <p> I rooted bluestacks and i was really excited to start rerolling like crazy and now im getting this issue. I have been playing the game for only 15 days and from today (after the update) i cant log in any more. The mesage is: An unauthorized program has been detected. Please exit all programs and try again.(101). The phone is rooted. Tried to re-install but that did nothing at all. Any way to fix this or should i just delete What does this mean? I saw a few threads I am on the SGS3 and my phone is NOT rooted it's just a normal phone that can't play this addicting game. Help is appreciated. Com2us you messed. This is my first post in reddit and I'm not native english speaker so please bear with me. Also I don't know where else to ask, sorry if I come to wrong forum. I played this game on my rooted android with some workaround by using ANRC until recent update. It was running smoothly. Now after update it won't open, only showing black screen with notice "an Unauthorized program has been detected. Please exit all program and try again" I want to play this game again and if possible I don't So after dec 9 maintainance patch "An unauthorized program has been detected. Please end the program and try again (103)" error is back for me. I tried everything I could think of except factory reset (which I won't do it took me hours to set up my tablet the way I wanted to, remove all bloatware etc.) and I could NOT pinpoint the cause. It doesn't help that the error message is so vague. Anyone else got this? If yes have you rooted/unrooted recently? Have you found out why it happens? Hey all, question. Is anyone here running the game on a rooted device and does NOT get the "An unauthorized program has been detected. Please end the program and try again (102)" message? I and at least some others currently get it after this patch and I'm trying to determin if it's Com2U going controll crazy banning all rooted devices or just some very speciffic root software! Cheers, Mojo-man. Just rooted my device and SS now gives me this message: "An unauthorized program has been detected. please close the program (error 103)" Does SS not play well with rooted devices? Anybody here played around with that before or encountered that issue. 
Hi I just recently updated my phone to the new firmware distributed by Huawei via EMUI which recently caused my phone to not allow me to play. The message i receive upon starting the game is "An unauthorized program has been detected. Please exit all programs and try again. (101)". I would like to know if this has occurred to anyone here and any simple practical solution for this problem. BTW I have already factory reset my phone. Help Autotouch is prohibited from running simultaniosly by the AceFishing Game. The programs get error "An unauthorized program has been detected" How can I make this great program to use on this game? thank. I just got the game on the emulator, but when I run it it says "An unauthorized program has been detected, please exit all programs and try again", but I don't have anything else running, my emulator it literally only has the bleach game, anyone knows Hello all, I really loved Summoners War but i don't have a phone that can run SW. Today after updating game, i kept getting "An unauthorized program has been detected" error. I read in forums that people fixed it by re-installing game. I did it and it keeps closing game while downloading resources. I did all the fixes i found in internet, but not working anymore. My question is, did Nox app just got blocked after last update? Anyone know any fix for this issue? And if not, is there any altern. I spent hours last night finding a working root for my Galaxy Note 3 and what am I rewarded with? " An unauthorized program has been detected. Please exit all programs and try again. (101)" every damn time I start the game. This forced me to uninstall all the rooted apps like Lucky Patcher and Xposed Framework that I worked so hard to get. This is absolutely ridiculous! Why should a game dictate what apps I can and cant have? I should be able to do what I want with my phone So a few days ago, I rooted my galaxy note 4 (T-Mobile) so I could use a mod to remove the stupid volume warning message. The first day everything was fine and dandy but on the second day I began receiving an error "an unauthorized program has been detected, please remove the program to continue. (101) I have tried using root cloaker through xposed. Root cloak pro by Cydia, and have even Uninstaller all root apps and disabled root. I have uninstalled and reinstalled SW during every configurat. EDIT: I fixed my problem! However, I'd like to leave this thread up instead of deleting it so that any future users having this problem know how to fix it. All I did was go into my SuperSU, go to the settings tab, and press the "Enable Superuser" button. What this does is temporarily turn off your root app access (it WILL NOT interfere with a custom ROM. I am using a custom ROM and my phone is still working perfectly fine with Superuser off.) until you turn it back on. This means I just grabbed Droid4X after checking out what the best andriod emulator was but I can't seem to get it run Bleach. It just keeps saying that an "unauthorized program has been detected". Can anyone help me figure out how to get the game running. A lot of times throughout the day while playing this I get this message: An unauthorized program has been detected. Please exit all programs and try again (101). When I press 'Okay' the game crashes and I'm brought back to my home screen. Any way to stop this? I lose energy and arena matches because 
Whenever I open BBS I get this message, "An unauthorized program has been detected. Please exit all programs and try again." I already disabled the root mode in settings to see if that would help and it did nothing. If anybody knows how to fix this please let me know. Thanks.

Hi everyone. I received my FoxxMount a few days ago and thought I’d share my thoughts. Want a TLDR? Foxx makes an excellent product and provides even better customer service. And now a longer review. After getting more serious about DCS in VR, it became clear that HOTAS position was going to matter more. Getting the stick and throttle into a more realistic position would really step things up. I saw three options: Monstertech, FoxxMount, and DIY. Monstertech wasn’t ideal because.

What order do I play the DLC in? When do I watch the anime?" This guide is my attempt to help answers those questions and to present a playthrough order that will give players the most well rounded and complete experience of the game. In addition to the game's DLC & multimedia, the story is also presented in a more non-linear fashion.

If you’re reading this, be thankful if you’re one of the ones awake. I’m the kind of doctor that can make you see a shade of blue that doesn’t exist. By selectively activating the region of your brain responsible for your perception of color, and tickling the right areas with a bit of electricity, I can make you see yellow-blue. Sometimes called a “forbidden color” by the popular media and science enthusiasts, what it really is is a way of circumventing the limits of your eyes by directly acces. I'm looking for an easy way to track my unlocks other than scrolling through my logs. I'm using the S8 frylog and I think I would be great to have an equally awesome way to quick reference my unlocks and inventory. Does anyone have something like a Fillable PDF of the magic item tables? So I can quickly see what's checked off? Or a good solution. 
So I have recently completed my AOWD with SSI, but what I didn’t know that the material on the app vanishes once you have completed the certification right away, which is bullshit from SSI’s side, since there are a few things that a diver may want to review post their certification, especially new skills we have learned in our last day of diving, etc. So in my case I was bedazzled, the course should have not been removed right away and the materials should be available to the diver I’m usually active from about 9am-2am EDT and respond very quickly.

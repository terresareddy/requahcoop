One Piece Treasure Cruise (ONE PIECE トレジャークルーズ) is a mobile gacha game (available for Android and iOS platforms) set in the One Piece universe. The game has been developed by Bandai Namco Entertainment. The English-language version of the game was released on February 8, 2015. The Japanese language version was available  Outside of a few empty ones, each has something different awaiting you: a treasure chest (beli, boosters, cotton candy, forbidden tome, limit break materials, etc.), a blue-gold star containing various amounts of Treasure Points (from few hundeds to over 10,000), a positive or negative modifier for upcoming battles So. I was talking with a friend who plays OPTC, and we were showing each other stuff in our games. I showed him some dokkan stuff, he showed me some optc stuff. He was stunned at the "quality" of our LR cards and the SA animations, but I was also impressed by some stuff they have over there. - Celebration cards: They get LOTS of celebration cards, and they're really useful, not like ours. - Raids and random events : If I remember well from what he said, sometimes And mobile games like even f2p games. I heard it only affects global. Hi all, amp#x200B; Im a longtime OPTC player and have tried soo many other gatcha games with no success. I know I want: 2D japanese art taptiming/swipe gameplay strategic rather than action mechanic grindy good community amp#x200B; But I've not found anything with the depth and longevity of OPTC yet. Any suggestions. Hello, i hope i can write a post like this without breaking some rules. To all gacha players. I'm trying to start in OPTC and since 9 hours i'm trying to reroll accounts but still nothing, just 1 legends and a bad legend in 9 hours. If someone is bored with that Gacha, can u help me gifting me an account? I will happy and finally i will play. Thanks gacha players 
is that game playable for new players? it's out for 4 years now and i played it 2 years ago but i wasn't that interested in gacha games like now today. After playing Dokkan for a while, there is a feature called extreme z awakening which basically improve the ability of outdated units that used to be good during the early stages of the game. If OPTC has something like EZA , for an example EHA (extreme haki awakening), will it work? This feature will help old legends become like at least a useful sub. This feature can be implemented in Garp Challenge every single month. After clearing the last Garp Challenge you sill be award with something. Before I start this off I just have to say, I don't have any problems with the artists themselves, they are extremely talented and I applaud them for that but I have something I need to discuss. While I may be new to this subreddit, I have been browsing it for quite a while, and I have been quite annoyed at the use of Treasure Cruise drawings being referenced and essentially copied without crediting the original source. Being someone who played the game for nearly 3 years, I've stopped recentl. One piece treasure cruise seems pretty interesting and but there are a few questions i want to ask: How are the drop rates? How good is the auto if there is any Are there any cool ultimate attacks or visuals in the game How grindy is the game? Additional info im up to date with the manga if it matters. Just a heads up, just got two of the three figures of that set cancelled from Amazon when i pre-ordered it way back in October. So i guess theres a chance i might not even get these at all now since i was relying on Amazon and now im going to have to try and see if i can order them somewhere else. Just thought id let others know if they paid for the pre-order on amazon.

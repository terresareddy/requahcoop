                            <p> Mission Statement. KDE neon provides an easy and elegant way for people to test the latest from KDE, or use the latest releases of KDE Software. Releases. Pinebook remix; Bionic Rebase. 
Review of KDE neon 5.15, an Ubuntu-based distribution with the latest Plasma desktop environment build, tested on a laptop with UEFI, GPT, 16 partitions, and a multi-boot Windows and Linux setup, with both User Edition and Developer Edition tests, covering live session, in-vivo upgrade and use, including look & feel, networking - Wireless, Bluetooth, Samba sharing, printing, multimedia KDE neon is the intersection of these needs using a stable Ubuntu long-term release as its core, packaging the hottest software fresh from the KDE Community ovens. KDE Neon does not include a lot of software in the default installation. Besides the KDE applications, Firefox is included as the default browser and VLC is installed as the default media player. Because the main purpose of KDE Neon is to showcase the KDE desktop, it makes sense to limit the number of installed applications to a minimum. KDE Neon is the latest and probably the best technology the KDE Community has developed, and i stand to be corrected if it is not so. You can call it a new Linux distro but KDE Neon is basically built comprehensively on Ubuntu Linux as the core, to bring the latest and hottest software developed by the KDE Community in a rolling release format to KDE desktop environment users. About KDE neon. KDE neon is a set of repositories via which KDE is distributed. It is also a set of disk images which contain easily installable versions of Ubuntu with a minimal set of apps and a KDE Plasma desktop, as well as a preconfigured KDE neon repository of your choice. Getting neon. Neon's website is neon.kde.org. Go to "Download. 
So, clarifying that it is a gerund, KDE neon is not a GNU / Linux distribution to use, but rather it is an Ubuntu with PPA of KDE and a "live" edition that allows us to test the set. And that we have done, would Subreddit dedicated to the the most up-to-date Frameworks and Plasma 5 packages based on the latest Ubuntu LTS. Post any KDE Neon-related posts. KDE neon is an interesting project. If we ignore the world, it does bring some fresh new changes into the Plasma universe, with significant improvements but also a handful of bugs and glitches. If we expand our view to include all other distributions, the scintillating allure of neon begins OSDisc.com is the leading source for Linux CDs and DVDs. Serving the Linux community for over 10 years. Don't waste time downloading Linux. Purchase ready-to-use CDs from .95. They both looks nice as im not a huge GNOME fan. But I want just a simple stable with that Ubuntu like feeling, using KDE. So which one? Is Kubuntu dead because its website seems not to have much news or its community saying much. Thanks. 
Recently with the 5.15.0 updates the KDE Neon User Edition has had many regressions. While I understand many are caused by the Qt update, the end result is that anyone who is looking to use KDE Neon for the first time is getting a terrible user experience. It's frustrating to see because usually KDE is so polished and it feels like the 5.15.0 release was put out to users a bit too quick. What is the process for how changes go from the Dev/Unstable/Stable releases into the User release?. I like the idea of KDE Neon. Latest and greatest from KDE and rock solid everything else. I can't use KDE Neon because I get this (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=712019) bug which is killer (seems to be a ubuntu issue) and I can't get any support for it. I have software that requires debs or rpms one of those distros would be great. Is there a way I can do this with fedora or debian. I'm thinking of switching to it and it would be great if someone could offer some kind of insight on it or just an honest critique of it, upsides/downsides. As per title. For some reason after upgrading to 5.12.8 (18.04 LTS) I started getting black borders around all firefox drop down menus (excluding "file edit " menus). Here is the image for it: https://imgur.com/ql5gNYy I assume this is due to broken GTK -gt KDE integration? It was not an issue previously. I honestly don't know what supposed to be there, I assume it is just failing to render shadow. At this stage I am reading up on firefoxcss/userChrome.css to see if I can completel. Right now I'm dual booting Neon (stable version) and Ubuntu Unity 16.04. The reason why I started using Neon is that I want some eye-candy (KDE lt3) with great stability and finally found some time to install it. Some applications I use now for important stuff kinda force me to use 18.04 rather than 16.04 as well, so I figured why not try out Neon. Now I feel that I can fully shift to Neon but I'm a bit skeptical about bleeding edge KDE. I don't want an update to ruin my setup suddenly. 
I've been having occasional freezing problems, especially every time I snap a window, but even sometimes when using the "expose"-like function to show all windows. It's very annoying. I've heard, BTW, that 5.15.4 was to fix problems with CPU usage when using Nvidia cards in Plasma 5, and I use a 1050 Ti on my laptop. Is this really a regression due to that "fix" from Nvidia? My driver version is 418.56, running on top of the newest KDE Neon and 4.18 Linux from Ubuntu. EDIT: I've discovered. Whilst I am very happy with the Plasma 5.15 desktop in KDE neon, I am surprised to notice that my version still is using the 4.8 Kernel. Is there a way I can force an update so I can get the latest 5.0 build. I'm looking to upgrade my graphics card to a 2Gb AMD Radeon one, replacing my Zotac GeFore 210 which is now unsupported. Has anyone had any experience using AMD Radeon cards in any Linux distro, particularly KDE Neon, which is my current daily driver? The card I am looking at, which is within budget, is this: https://www.ebuyer.com/645225-asus-radeon-r5-230-2gb-ddr3-vga-dvi-hdmi-pci-e-graphics-card-r5230-sl-2gd3-l (https://www.ebuyer.com/645225-asus-radeon-r5-230-2gb-ddr3-vga-dvi-hdmi-pci-e-. The current version of Qt is 5.12.0, but Qt Creator is still 4.6.2. This version doesn't work well with the new Qt version in KDE neon - for instance it's not possible to create Qt Quick projects (it says "no valid kits found"), and if one is created manually, it won't recognize any new Qt Quick features (such as per-popup \`Overlay.modal\` instead of the legacy per-window \`overlay.modal\`). I tried to use KDevelop, but it seems that it still can't parse basic QML, so Qt Creator is unfortunate. </p>
